 * The concept of a scene in The Simplicity Engine is an object that represents a 3D environment. It can be fed to another object for rendering,
 * picking, application of physics etc. A scene contains a scene graph with separate lists containing the cameras and lights.vThese cameras and
 * lights should also be related to nodes in the scene graph to give them a position and orientation in the 3D environment.
